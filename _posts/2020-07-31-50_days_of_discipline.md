The title is self-descriptive, I'm commiting to the challenge of being disciplined
for at least 50 days. And I will be blogging about it here :nerd_face:

To give you some context, in the next couple of paragraphs I am going to describe how it is that
I decided to embark in this journey. Then I will proceed with my weekly updates, which are intended
to be a kind of personal journal, but you are free to read if you want to :blush:

### A Brief Intro

In the beginning of this month, July 2020, I received an email from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
saying that I had been accepted into the Azure Machine Learning Scholarship program, developed in colaboration
with Microsoft. They even gave me a badge:

To make story short, during this scholarship the moderators launched something called the \#50DaysofUdacity Challenge,
where you commit to study the course content for 50 days for at least 30 min. a day. I loved the idea inmediately! But
because I was already working on the habit of (book) reading and doing physical exercise, I decided to give a twist
to this challenge. So, for me it is the \#50DaysofDiscipline Challenge, where I commit for 50 days to study, read a book
and do some physical exercise. And yes, I have a full time job at L'Or√©al.

### My Journey

At the time of this writing, I am in day 9 of the \#50DaysofDiscipline Challenge.

My idea is to write weekly a brief summary of the week that just passed.

* Week 1
    - Azure Machine Learning: I completed Lesson 1 (introduction to the course) and almost all the lectures in Lesson 2 (Introduction to Machine Learning)
	I liked the content. I could refresh some basic ML concepts and learn about their implementations in Azure Machine Learning Studio.
	- Book Reading: Finished reading chapter 4 of [Mastery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009U1U2IU).
	- Physical Training: Mixed some weight training with CrossFit training (at home). On weekend, I went for a bike ride.

* Week 2
