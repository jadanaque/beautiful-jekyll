Hi! My name is Javier Adanaque and I consider myself a data geek. So, as you may imagine, I will be writing  a lot about data-related stuff: Stats, R Programming, DataViz & more.

I am formally trained in economics (major), but currently enrolled in a graduate program in Data Science (a 300  hours program that is not a Master!). I've not settled in one topic yet, but I really enjoy Machine Learning and DataViz.

Oh! I almost forget to tell you that I also work ☺. I am a Data Manager at L'Oréal, in Peruvian Headquarters.

Well, thanks for reading something about me. I hope my mix of interests and knowledge make me write stuff you enjoy.
